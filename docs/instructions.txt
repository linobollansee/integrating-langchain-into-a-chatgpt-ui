Exercise: Build a Custom ChatGPT Web App
Goal
Create a full-stack chat application where a user can send messages through a React frontend, which are routed to an Express backend. The backend calls the ChatGPT API, stores the conversation in a database, and returns the assistant’s reply to be displayed in the frontend.

Part 1: Backend (Express + Database)
Set up a new Express project.
Configure it to:

Accept JSON requests.
Handle CORS so the frontend can connect.
Add an endpoint to:

Accept a user message.
Call the ChatGPT API using your API key.
Save both the user message and assistant response into a database.
Return the assistant response as JSON.
Add another endpoint that allows the frontend to fetch the full conversation history from the database.
Use a simple relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) with a messages table.
Part 2: Frontend (React)
Create a React project for the chat UI.
Build a simple chat interface with:

A message list showing both user and assistant messages.
An input field for typing messages.
A button to send a message.
When the user submits a message:

Send it to the backend’s chat endpoint.
Append the user’s message to the chat window immediately.
Display the assistant’s reply once it’s received.
On page load, fetch the entire conversation history from the backend and display it in the chat window.
Part 3: Extension Challenges
Add streaming responses from the backend so that messages appear word-by-word (typing effect).
Add support for multiple chat sessions by introducing a session_id.
Implement LangChain in your ChatGPT UI Project and wrap all of the api requests with LangChain.
